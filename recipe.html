				<p class="background-text">I really like lemon bars. But there aren't any free and aesthetic images of lemon bars, so here are some pictures of mildly related content.</p>
				<p class="background-text">I've made lemon bars multiple times throughout my life and I've found a few favorite recipes. However, after baking different lemon bars, and asking people to compare them, I learned that the filling from one recipe was better, whereas the crust for the other recipe was better. Thus, I decided to combine the two into a single recipe for my reference. I have yet to actually try making this new recipe, but I am excited to do so!</p>
				<p class="background-text">The recipe for the crust is from <a href="http://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/lemon-bars/">Laura in the Kitchen.</a><br>The recipe for the filling is from the Costco Wholesale recipe book.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a 9 by 13 inch baking pan with aluminum foil and set aside.</li>
					<li>In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the crust and mix together until it forms a dough. Press the dough in the bottom and halfway up the sides of the baking pan and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes.</li>
					<li>In another bowl, whisk together the 1-1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Whisk in eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.</li>
					<li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes. The bars will firm up as they cool.</li>
					<li>Once the pan has cooled, cut into 2-inch squares and dust with confectioners's ugar, if desired. Arrange in a checkerboard fashion on a desesrt tray. Garnish with a lemon wedge. Makes 24 servings.</li>
